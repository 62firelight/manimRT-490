# ManimRT

ManimRT is a Manim plug-in that lets users create Manim-based animations that can easily demonstrate key ray-tracing concepts (e.g., ray-object intersections, lighting computations, reflections and refractions).

ManimRT is still a very early WIP. Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/62firelight/manimRT-490/wiki) for more information.
